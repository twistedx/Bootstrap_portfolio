                          <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio page. My name is Sean Gowing. I have a multitude of life experience
                              and decided that web development was going to be my next new frontier</p>
                          <p>Prior to doing web development I was a US Marine for 7 years. I did one deployment to Iraq in 2004 in
                              support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. One thing I can say about Iraq was "It's hot!!!!" The hottest day,
                              while we were there, was 135 degrees</p>
                          <p>After getting out of the Marine Corps I was a Police Officer for 15 years. Due to a back injury, I was
                              forced to retire at 38 years old. I had the pleasure of working in jobs like narcotics, SWAT, SWAT
                              Sniper, Bicycle Patrol, and fugitive apprehension team. I have worked with other agencies like DEA, ATF, ABC,
                              and many others. I have spent a lot of time in the courtroom testifying in front of many juries for a
                              multitude of crimes such as murder, child endangerment as well as narcotic related offenses as well as gang crimes. </p>
                          <p>After retiring from the Department, This brought me to my next new career in programming and web
                              development. I really enjoy working with computers and have been using since 386's came out.</p>
                          <p>This portfolio will be a work in progress for me and I hope you enjoy seeing the projects that I am
                              working on.</p>
